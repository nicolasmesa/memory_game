# Memory Game

This is a simple memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can read more about how it was built [here](https://blog.nicolasmesa.co/posts/2024/12/memory-game/). I also have it running [here](https://memory-game.nicolasmesa.co/).

# Running locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Start a local server (I use `python3 -m http.server`)
3. Open the game in your browser.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Add the name of the players.
3. Select photos from your device. I recommend between 5 - 10 photos.
4. Optionally, select a photo to use as the back side of the cards.
5. Tap on the "Start Game" button.
6. Tap on a card to flip it over.
7. Tap on another card to try to find a match.
8. If you find a match, the cards will disappear and the player who found the match will get a point. Additionally, the player will keep going until they don't find any matches (or the game is over).
9. If you don't find a match, the cards will flip back over and it will be the next player's turn.
10. Keep going until you've found all the matches.
